I've always wanted to write a blog ever since my mum started a blogger when I was two years old to avoid going crazy from being a stay at home mum.

Unfortunately I do not have children nor the writing acumen of my mother, but I did inherit her arrogance. Thus, the blog!

The first post is [Using a Submodule as a Reference](posts/submodule-as-reference.md) which I wrote on the 2nd of February 2025 as the start of an attempt to make a blog post about my projects every week in a nested attempt to make me work on my projects every week. As I'm writing this, I have already failed at this as the second post was finished on the 10th of February 2025.

Anyway, this repository serves as 1. the version control for my posts, and 2. will eventually have a CI/CD pipeline to convert each post from Markdown to HTML for when I eventually write my blog app and set up auto deployments to it.

For now, here are the current written posts, as well as a short description of them:

# 2025
## February
- Week 1: [Using a Submodule as a Reference](posts/submodule-as-reference.md) - Experimenting with more advanced Git features and automating them.
